Here, I add stochastic starformation history in two forms:
1. Usual attempt, with t student distribution for limiting the SFR change between each step.
2. Iyer+24 attempt, with 5 parameters with physical motivation used for regulation.

I have tested this implementation with my paper [Lisiecki+](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250910117L/abstract), submitted. If you use this repository, please cite my paper, thanks!

The idea behind the repository is simple. You have sucessfully installed **CIGALE v2022.1** or **CIGALE v2025.0** (this one was not extensively tested, please report any bugs/problems). Download my repo and find the corresponding version. Merge directories.

IMPORTANT note: unfortunatelly, the installation is not so easy while working with pip-installed version of CIGALE.
Unfortunatelly, if you have such version, probably you have to rebuild the whole thing with my files within source file.
